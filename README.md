# IMPORTANT NOTES
## As of now SaturnNX utilizes the php web shell exploit to boot payloads, which could be potentially dangerous. I do intend on changing the PHP coding language to a more safe alternative
## USE SATURNNX AT YOUR OWN RISK

# SaturnNX Usage Guide

### Preparing
- Install and launch Zadig.
- Plug your Switch into your PC while it's in RCM mode
- Select Options > List All Devices
- Select the APX device and check which driver is installed for this specific device
- If libusbK is not the current driver, install it

### Installation
- [Download SaturnNX](https://github.com/kckarnige/saturnNX/releases)
- Extract SaturnNX.rar (or SaturnNX.zip)
- Open saturn.exe (If a Windows Defender window pops up, click "More Info" and "Run Anyway")
- Click on the payload you're using, and enjoy!
