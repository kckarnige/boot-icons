# IMPORTANT NOTES
**As of now, SaturnNX relies on the PHP web shell exploit to boot payloads, this could be potentially dangerous.**

**I do intend on changing the PHP exploit to something safer, and possibly more compact, like C, Java, or Python, but for now PHP will have to do.**
### USE THIS TOOL AT YOUR OWN RISK

# SaturnNX Usage Guide

### Preparing
- [Install and launch Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/)
- Plug your Switch into your PC while it's in RCM mode
- Select Options > List All Devices
- Select the APX device and check which driver is installed for this specific device
- If libusbK is not the current driver, install it
